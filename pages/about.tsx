									Jaclyn began her yoga journey in college, when she took a semester-long class at the University of Cincinnati. In this class, she was exposed to a variety of yoga styles including Hatha, Vinyasa, Ashtanga, and Yin. Jaclyn fell in love with how yoga could be so versatile in style and accessibility. Since this class Jaclyn had a small dream being a yoga teacher, but the timing was never right. She continued to practice on her own and at various studios over the years. Fast forward to 2019, Jaclyn was an overwhelmed elementary school teacher expecting her first child. She began taking a weekly prenatal yoga class to relieve stress and help with the aches and pains of pregnancy. She immediately fell in love with prenatal yoga and hoped to teach this one day.

									In March 2020, Jaclyn&apos;s daughter was born and the pandemic hit. She decided to leave elementary education and set out to follow her dreams of becoming a yoga teacher and balancing the stay-at-home-mom life. Jaclyn has since completed her 200 & 300 HR YTT through Uplifted Yoga with Brett Larkin and an 85-hour prenatal yoga course with Shanti Mom Yoga while being pregnant with her second daughter. Jaclyn loves to learn, teach, and connect with her students. She is in the thick of motherhood herself and has developed a passion for providing moms with a safe, supportive space to relax and connect with themselves, baby, and other mamas.
